## What is it

* Built with pure CSS: CSS Modal is built out of pure CSS. JavaScript is only for sugar. This makes them perfectly accessible.
* Pressing escape: If you press <kbd>ESC</kbd> on your keyboard while the modal is visible
it closes itself. This behavior cannot be achieved with CSS only.
* There is an event `cssmodal:modal` fired on the modal itself after the modal is shown. Another event `cssmodal:hidden` is fired after the modal is hidden.
